# Abyss-Backend(Aero)

aero an innovative, first of its kind, interception-based web proxy from, has now been open-sourced! It has the best site compatibility and is the fastest proxy by far.

# How to use aero

1. Make sure your backend serves an aero [backend](https://github.com/aero-backends) correctly
2. Make sure you included aero into your site
3. Create a service worker like this in the topmost directory

```js
import handle from "./aero/handle.js";
import dynamicUpdates from "./aero/updates.js";

self.addEventListener("install", event => self.skipWaiting());

self.addEventListener("fetch", async event =>
	event.respondWith(
		handle(event).catch(err => new Response(err.stack, { status: 500 }))
	)
);

dynamicUpdates();
```

4. Register the service worker in a script on your main page like this
   _This example uses our [sdk](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/sdk); this allows you to safely manage deployments of multiple proxies, and supports dynamic config updates_

```js
import { proxyApi } from "./aero/config.js";

import ProxyManager from "./sdk/ProxyManager.js";

const proxyManager = new ProxyManager();

proxyManager.add("/sw.js", proxyApi);
```

# Directories

**apis** API interceptors for site code
**workerApis** Worker-related API interceptors
**injects** - Code added to the site as a script that isn't a hook
**rewriters** - Rewriters
**util** - miscellaneous modules
...

## When will aero release...

Nowadays, there will never be any released dates announced before the feature is ready. Be patient and the time will come.

## Why doesn't aero work on iOS?

The bug is Apple's fault not ours, since Safari doesn't support the Service Worker standard. This would normally be fine in most mobile operating systems but due to the restrictions apple imposes on the apps, browsers are forced to use Safari's engine. This yet another problem with monopolies and proprietary software.

## What is the purpose of aero / What differs from it's competition?

Unlike other proxies, we are more focused on experimentation originally to introduce interception proxies, which was why aero was originally made. Every way that it works is different to its predecessors. The focus has changed after it served its original purpose, and are now trying to achieve every site support in the upcoming months, while having the best speed and extensibility possible. This means that we support way more edge cases than any other proxies giving us the highest compatibility. You may notice that other proxies support more major sites than us; this is due to their hacky solutions that often focus on the short term, rather than the long term. Eventually, we will surpass our flaws. aero does its own thing and never follows competition.

# The difference from other proxies

## Precedence

Previously, proxies could barely handle more than one person, this was due to all the site's code being rewritten on the backend. Because the code was being rewritten on the backend, it required having to share backend rewrite code with frontend code. This was not only slow, but also allowed the possibility of Slowloris attacks against the proxies.

## Interception

aero takes a different approach by not only completely avoiding rewrites, but also by doing all the rewrites on the frontend with no parsers! This allows the response times to be O(1) with no speed delay. It does this by intercepting requests through a service worker, where the request is routed to the while also injecting important scripts. This prevents the need to hook into code that previously needed to be rewritten to redirect requests saving time and resources. All of its conceptual methods are optimal.

## Extensibility

One of our strengths is Extensibility. This is done by making aero readable and customizable by anyone. Every aspect of it is documented. Even if you are not a programmer, you can understand how aero works. There are configs to control functionality - in order to have no compromises and allow those who can't write code to easily customize it. If you are a programmer, you will probably appreciate all the hooks and guiding variables we have to easily modify the code. We are working on an even better way of making extensions: event-driven middleware that takes advantage of its internals.

## HTML Interception

HTML is intercepted and rewritten through a Mutation Observer where important elements are rewritten. Script elements with inline code and elements with integrity values set need to be cloned due to the browser's security restrictions.

## Deep Scope Property Checking

Location objects are replaced with a fake Location api, and also in the case of the site trying to escape the location scoping bracket property accessors for certain objects are checked using our scope function that evaluates the expression in hopes of intercepting the attempted location or window call. Additionaly, this scoping is integrated into Eval, Function Class, and Reflect interceptors. _Support for this feature is enabled in flags_

## Cors Emulation

Unlike other proxies that simply delete the cors policy and ignore it, aero abides by the intended security features by keeping them in place. Without Cors Emulation, sites can infer either the browser doesn't support modern security standards or that a proxy is being used. This means that the site would've been lacking support; no longer with aero! This isn't fully complete yet, as we still have more rules to finish. _Support for this feature is enabled in flags_
